To run this, use : npm run both

Reminder for myself about certain Dependencies incase I used something else other than Nodejs for the backend :
-i used cors to specify which URLs can connect with the backend.
-i used concurrently to run both frontend and backend with one command.

whats next ?
-add something new to the project or remake it for practice...
-i should remove all css and style the whole thing by myself...
